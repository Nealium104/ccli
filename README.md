# Hello there
This is a little CLI game I'm working on. The idea is that it will be a little coding playground where I can make some coding challenges and tests for them.

# When will it be "finished"?
This project is considered a success when:
* The game has at least 2 different menus that go to other places
* The game uses ascii art in at least 2 places
* The game has a way of storing/removing items from the player
* The game has at least 2 sections with at least 3 exercises and asscociated tests
